# 🎵 Spotify Top Artists & Tracks Visualizer 🎨  

Welcome to the **Spotify Top Artists & Tracks Visualizer**! This project allows users to **log in with their Spotify account** and view their **top 10 artists and tracks** in an engaging way using **D3.js**. 

## 🚀 Project Overview
This app showcases **your most-listened-to music**, helping you explore the trends in your Spotify listening habits. It's built entirely on the **front-end**, so no backend is required, and it runs smoothly on **GitHub Pages**.
